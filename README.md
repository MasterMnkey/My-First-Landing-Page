# My-First-Landing-Page

In this project i'm trying to make a landing page with a design that provided from Odin Project.

For the most of it i'm only using flex-box and make the design as same as possible.

![Design example from odin project](01.png) ![Color and font style](02.png)

I divide it into 6 section :
1. Header
2. container 1
3. container 2
4. container 3
5. container 4
6. footer

<br>

1. In the header I just using div element and list for the links
2. in the container 1 I divide to 2 section (the text and button) and the image placeholder
3. container 2 using list for the box and the text and i think it make it easier to style it
4. the container 3 just 2 P element and align it
5. and in container 4 i use container again for the sign-up button and the text and style it and center it
6. in the footer i just set the height and that's it 

The problem I encountered is the design i make is wider and the example is slimmer.

My very first html and css coding, Way to Go my self wahoo.

plz in the future review this again.
